###Final Project Summary

Data visualization tool using d3 + HTML + Python for NBA clustering (k-means)



###Tasks for Week 4/16/14

1. Explore integration of d3 + HTML into Python and build a simple interface that allow calls into the Python backend as well as retrieve data from it 
2. Standardize/clean existing datasets (have one csv file indexed by players)
3. Build python skeleton that uses SKLearning to create k-means clustering on demand


###Update 4/19/14
1. It looks like integrating d3 with a python backend can be done fairly easily through flask. I've uploaded a 'Hello World' style app that runs by running python app.py check out /test for a little demo of how we can process data with pandas and feed it to the front end.
